## Introduction

This repository is a log of my progress as I learn and experiment with OpenCV for image processing. The goal is to cover a wide range of topics and applications in computer vision.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed. You can install OpenCV using pip:

```sh
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
```

## Topics Covered

### Reading Images and Videos

- **Reading an Image**: Learn how to read and display images using OpenCV's `cv.imread()` and `cv.imshow()` functions.
- **Reading a Video**: Explore how to read and display video frames using `cv.VideoCapture()` and loop through each frame.

### Rescaling Frames

- **Rescaling**: Understand how to rescale images and videos to different sizes, typically for reducing computational load.

### Drawing Shapes

- **Rectangle, Circle, Line**: Discover how to draw various shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines on images using OpenCV's drawing functions.

### Putting Text

- **Adding Text**: Learn how to put text on images with customizable fonts, sizes, and colors.

### Image Transformations

- **Translation**: Shift images along the x and y axes.
- **Rotation**: Rotate images around a specified center point.
- **Flipping**: Flip images vertically, horizontally, or both.
- **Resizing**: Change the dimensions of images while maintaining aspect ratio.

### Color Spaces

- **BGR to RGB/Grayscale/HSV/LAB**: Convert images between different color spaces for various image processing tasks.

### Blurring Techniques

- **Averaging**: Apply simple averaging blur to smooth out images.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Use Gaussian blur for a more natural-looking smoothness.
- **Median Blur**: Effectively remove noise with median blur.
- **Bilateral Filtering**: Preserve edges while blurring using bilateral filtering.

### Bitwise Operations

- **Bitwise AND/OR/XOR/NOT**: Perform fundamental bitwise operations on images, often used for masking and combining image regions.
