## Introduction

This repository is a log of my progress as I learn and experiment with OpenCV for image processing. The goal is to cover a wide range of topics and applications in computer vision.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed. You can install OpenCV using pip:

```sh
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
